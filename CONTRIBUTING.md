# Contributing to charts-grafana

All kinds of contributions are welcome, whether they are improvements to
documentation, feedback or new ideas, or improving the application directly with
bug fixes, improvements to existing features or adding new features.

## Start with a Github issue

In all cases, following this workflow will help all contributors to `om` to
participate more equitably:

1. Search existing github issues that may already describe the idea you have.
   If you find one, consider adding a comment that adds additional context about
   your use case, the exact problem you need solved and why, and/or your interest 
   in helping to contribute to that effort.
2. If there is no existing issue that covers your idea, open a new issue to
   describe the change you would like to see. Please provide as much
   context as you can about your use case, the exact problem you need solved and why,
   and the reason why you would like to see this change. If you are reporting a bug, 
   please include steps to reproduce the issue if possible.
3. Any number of folks from the community may comment on your issue and ask
   additional questions. Anyone from the community may step in to make that change.
4. If you intend to make the changes, comment on the issue to indicate your
   interest in working on it to reduce the likelihood that more than one person
   starts to work on it independently.
